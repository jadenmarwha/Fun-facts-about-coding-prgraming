        <h2>Fact 1:</h2>
        <p>Programming is like solving a puzzle. It's all about breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces and using <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and <code>while</code> statements to make them fit together.</p>

        <h2>Fact 2:</h2>
        <p>In coding, precision matters. A missing semicolon (<code>;</code>) or a tiny syntax error can lead to hours of debugging.</p>

        <h2>Fact 3:</h2>
        <p>Code is a language of its own. Learning to code is like learning a new language, with its own vocabulary, grammar, and idioms.</p>

        <h2>Fact 4:</h2>
        <p>Comments in code (<code>// like this</code>) serve as notes to yourself and others. They can make your code more understandable.</p>

        <h2>Fact 5:</h2>
        <p>Programming languages are constantly evolving. New languages and frameworks emerge, and existing ones receive updates to adapt to changing technology needs.</p>

        <h2>Fact 6:</h2>
        <p>Debugging is a significant part of coding. Most of a developer's time is spent finding and fixing errors in the code, no matter how experienced they are.</p>

        <h2>Fact 7:</h2>
        <p>Open-source software is a cornerstone of the coding world. Many programming tools and libraries are developed and maintained by communities of volunteers.</p>

        <h2>Fact 8:</h2>
        <p>Version control systems like Git help programmers collaborate and keep track of changes to code. They're essential for managing code in teams.</p>

        <h2>Fact 9:</h2>
        <p>Learning to code is a continuous journey. There is always something new to learn, even for seasoned developers.</p>

        <h2>Fact 10:</h2>
        <p>Coding and programming are used in diverse fields, from web development and mobile apps to artificial intelligence, robotics, and even creative arts like digital music and visual effects.</p>
